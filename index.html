                    <p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.
                        Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild  to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes,chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.<br>
                        The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the COVID-19 virus,the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face.<br>
                        The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes,so it’s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).</p>

                        <p>A little over a year since India first began its battle with the covid-19 pandemic, and it is apparent to any observer that once again, India is standing more towards the losing half. In March 2020, confronted with the emergence of the virus and simultaneous lack of resources to tackle the same, especially in terms of medical infrastructure, the Indian government opted for a nationwide lockdown. Therefore, despite the many negative economic consequences, this hard response did succeed in keeping control of the spread while India acquired the necessary resources and began working on vaccines. Now, the country is in the midst of a grave second wave with cases rising to numbers higher than last year, and the response seems to be lacking. One reason behind this, no doubt, is the heavy influence of politics that seeps into all aspects of life. For instance, the government’s reluctance to impose reasonable restrictions during the flurry of public gatherings took place from August 2020 onwards. </p>

                        <h3>COVID-MANAGEMENT AND POLITICAL IMPACT:-</h3>
                        <i class="fas fa-plus"></i>
                        <i class="fas fa-minus"></i>

                    <div class="answer_3">
                        <p>We can take lessons from the state of Kerala. Initial response to COVID-19 by Kerala was claimed as one of the success stories quoted as the state managed to mitigate the crisis and bring down cases rapidly as early as May. However, later found, it was an early celebration because the instances kept rising after that. It has begun with a public gathering celebration of the Onam festival, followed by Christmas later on in December. It is characteristic of politics not directly to intervene with such functions despite the negative long-term impact, and therefore in Kerala, these were celebrated without much restriction. 

Maharashtra is another example where the cases rose and contributed more than 30% in the overall cases. Maharashtra is one of the epicentres of the Covid-19 issues, continuously contributing for the last four months. The political misgovernance and mismanagement have badly hampered the battle against Covid-19 in the state. 

The election is another occasion that has been contributed to the current rise of Covid-19 cases. In India, the election is part of daily life; the election process would be taking place in either part of the country, whether it is local, state, or general elections or by-election. Every state has its function to conduct local body elections; that’s why we do not have a system for all the election processes. PM Modi is keeping advocating for ‘One Nation, One Election to save time and resources, which we keep spending on the elections. Due to political compulsion, his demand is still pending as many political parties do not agree to this demand. For the implementation of ‘One Nation One Election, some state assemblies must resolve early or come under the president rule.</p>

                        <h3>DECLINED STATE OF THE COUNTRY:-</h3>
                        <i class="fas fa-plus"></i>
                        <i class="fas fa-minus"></i> 
                    </a>
                    <div class="answer_3">
                        <p>Headlines are made every day about the political processions, unceasing rallying and political strategies playing out in the state, yet what is missed is the steady spike of cases resulting from the same. A suitable suggestion here would be for the government to give the current state governments an extension, keeping them in power until the vaccine rollout is more or less complete. Or, imposing a president’s rule in the state is an equally viable option given the current circumstances. Unfortunately, given that politics is so ingrained, it is improbable that elections will be postponed to prioritize health and safety. 

 

The imposition of weekend lockdowns and night curfews is being adopted by many states – Delhi, Maharashtra, Punjab, MP, Uttar Pradesh – in response to the recent surge of cases. When the economy had started displaying signs of persevering and recovering from the first lockdown impacts, such a response now is only the convenient way out for state governments, but it is far from well planned. To announce a lockdown is an easy way of shifting responsibility from government response to the citizens by keeping them inside. Serious reconsiderations need to be made concerning second wave response, as the poor will be the worst hit by a second lockdown.

 

The lockdown again will attack the poor’s livelihood who are employed in restaurants, hotels, taxi’s or employed/self-employed in other dependents fields.

These night curfew and restriction will hamper the cities’ economic activities, and labourer will again leave the city in the absence of viable livelihood options. They have already been going to the cities, which will ultimately affect the economy of the towns. 

 

Most states where cases are increasing had not paid much heed in the early phase when situations were going out of hand. States like Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh and Punjab are not taking adequate steps.  Instead of fighting a battle against the Covid-19, these states are fighting with the central government on another turf. Maharashtra is one example that has overlooked the severity of the Covid-19 and started doing politics when it is getting uncontrolled. </p>
